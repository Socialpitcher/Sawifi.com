                `<strong>Rogers</strong>, on the other hand, starts their basic plans at <strong>$54.99/month</strong>. While this is slightly higher, Rogers shines when it comes to bundling servicesâ€”combining internet, TV, and mobile into one package for extra savings.`,

                `For both providers, prices can vary based on location and promotions, but overall, <strong>Telus</strong> offers a more cost-effective option in this <strong>Telus vs. Rogers internet comparison.</strong>`,

Their entry-level plans offer speeds starting at 100 Mbps, and they also provide <strong>Gigabit internet</strong> for users who need faster speeds. However, cable networks can slow down during peak times due to shared bandwidth.`,

                `<strong>Rogers</strong>, while generally reliable, may experience slowdowns during peak hours since their cable internet is shared among multiple users in the same area.`,
